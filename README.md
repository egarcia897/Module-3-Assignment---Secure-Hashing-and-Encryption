#Module 3: Assignment - Secure Hashing and Encryption
# Simple Cryptography App with Role-Based Login

##Overview
This Python application demonstrates basic cryptography and role-based login. 
Users can log in as an admin "Mr.Emily" with password "admin245" or user "Andrew" with password "user245", 
to access SHA-256 hashing, Caesar cipher encryption, and digital signatures.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
cryptography library
    install with pip : pip install cryptography

## How to Run
1. Download or clone repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run program

## Example Output
Enter username: Mr. Emily
Enter password: admin245
Welcome Mr.Emily! Role: admin
Enter text to hash (or press Enter for 'test'):

Encrypted: Khoor
Decrypted: Hello
SHA-256 Hash: <hash_here>
Signature verified!

##NOTES
Admin login: Mr.Emily / admin245
User login: Andrew / user245
Caesar cipher encrypts "Hello" by default.
